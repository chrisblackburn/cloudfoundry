cloudfoundry
============

This is a collection of Chef cookbooks and associated paraphernalia for kick-starting the install of a CloudFoundry environment. The nuts and bolts of the install is taken care of by the CloudFoundry chef setup scripts; this repository gives you a more Chef-like way to manage storing the configuration of your environment and provides the necessary pre-requisites for the CloudFoundry scripts to run.

You'll need [littlechef](https://github.com/tobami/littlechef/littlechef) to run the fix commands.
